# CONICHI(SMART HOTEL) - Smart checkout Application

## Timeline

This timeline is the way to evaluate, how much time taken to setup the application step by step.

### Application basic setup

```
Date: 12/07/2019
Duration: 1hr
```

- Folder structure
- basic npm dependency
- webpack and dev server
- Hello world application

Here for local development I am using webpack-dev-server which is equivalent of express we can do customization as well.

### Unit Test Setup

I can use karma, jasmine, but I find **jest** having reach feature and faster execution.
I am going to use **Jest** which is a best unit test runner.

To work with react components **enzyme** is the best tool out there.

### BDD Setup

As I found protractor besically work with Angular, we can do some hack to make it run in react as well. So here I have two choice

- WebdriverIo (Cross browser)
- Cypress (Run in chrome)

Here I am going to use Cypress as a test automation tool.

```
Why I am using cypress?

- First test execution
- Debugging faster
- Developers friendly
- Time travel
- Descriptive commands

```

### DOCKER SETUP
